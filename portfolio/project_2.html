                <p>My tutor handed me a new brief to design an app that can be used to help other students. The main challenge of the
                brief was to include either a Virtual Reality or an Augmented Reality feature. I decided to go with Augmented Reality
                (AR), and my idea was to create a social media app to help students feel more comfortable moving to a new city. I was
                praised by my tutor and fellow students about my new idea to share notes in your local area. My tutor asked me to
                develop this further, using the solid feedback I received from other students. “This is a really fun new interaction
                that a lot of students moving to a new city would find extremely useful!”

                <p>Problem: How can I combine an AR feature with a social media platform so that students will find it exciting? And how
                will it compare to the already popular tech giants of today like Facebook, Instagram & SnapChat?
                </p>

                <p>Solution: I designed a new information sharing app based in the users local area. Using Augmented Reality, 
                students who move to a new city will be able to find exciting places to visit or read about the history of the city by
                scattering notes around the city. These notes can be anything from a review of a restaurant, information
                about the importance of a location, or asking other users to come to an event thats happening in the city right now.

            <article class="item-e" class="p-left">
                <p>The first screen you load into is the map of your current location. The user will see different note icons placed around the map. Users
                will naturally be looking down at their phone so by raising the phone up, the user is looking through a window
                into AR mode where they will be able to see the digital notes placed by other students. The user can then expand the
                note to view more details and check out what others are saying in the comments below.

                <h4>This to me felt like a real-time social media experience. The overwhelming feedback from everyone was great and I felt I
                was really onto something here. The AR feature was the most popular but also the most confusing to use. Therefore I
                revisited the design process and sketched out a new way for users to easily access the AR mode and view/ create notes
                really simply. This is my favourite idea for an app and I wish to continue developing it and releasing it onto the App
                Store in the future. Here are some of the talking points I would be glad to talk to you about at an interview: <br>
