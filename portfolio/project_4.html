                <p>The Penguin Random House tasked me with creating three book covers from their wide selection of classic books. The
                design for the three books had to carry the same theme and same typeface.

                <p>Having been a fan of the film, I knew before reading the book about how grand and theatrical F. Scott Fitzgerald's story
                would be. My design was inspired by the endless parties that Gatsby would host and the twisted relationship between him
                and Nancy. I drew out a house so big that it would be fitting to call a castle. By the the time I was developing it in
                Illustrator, I was in a repetitive mood of drawing many many windows. In the book, a green flashing light from is
                mentioned throughout the book but I wanted the colour of the cover to be purple. Purple has connotations of wealth and
                the story follows a world of very wealthy characters who seem to lack humanity. I imagined these parties lasting all
                night long with a purple-tint from fireworks, music and bottomless glasses of alcohol.

                <p>Told from the perspective of a curious child who is growing up in the American countryside, To Kill a Mockingbird is a
                staple of fine literature. There was a thrilling chapter in the book that I could not put the book down on and this is
                what inspired me to design the front cover. Two children playing which goes too far, one ends at the bottom of the road
                at the entrance of a mysterious family home, only to be seen through the eyes of children as a heart-pounding
                nightmare. Being told time and again to not get too close to that house, the children run away when they see a tall
                looming figure in the window watching them. This design captures a lot of action and mystery. The bright yellow contrasts 
                well with the dark silhouettes as it represents a hot sunny day in the American countryside.

                <p>The Day of the Triffids was a thrilling read and was recommended to me by a friend. I enjoyed the story of the daily
                struggle to live in a post apocalyptic world with dangerous plants and how the power of sight was considered a gifted
                advantage. This book cover captures where the characters destination is by drawing a long road that ends in the city of
                London. I designed the book cover to make the reader ask more questions than answers. We do not know why the
                character wants to go there, or what those plants or doing scattering around or how it relates to comets in the sky. The
                green tone of the cover symbolises the great flash that blinds everyone and also represents the colour of
                the Triffids who are now humanities biggest threat.

                <h4>The brief told me to do what every mum tells you not to do: Judge a book by its cover. But I had an amazing time diving
                into each story, and dragging out a small piece of information that could visually hint at the story but not give it
                away. The theme for each book was a dark silhouette of 2d layers that gave the design some perspective. The books also
                have a scratchy look to them to add texture and definition properties.</h4>
