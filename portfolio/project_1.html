                <h1>Focus OS – A less distracting device.</h1>
                <h4>Role: UX Researcher, UX/ UI Designer, Visual Designer</br>
                    Conducted user profiles, sketched and created wireframes, created hi-fi mockups, prototyped with hi-fi comps
                </h4>
                <p>For my Final Major Project at University, I set my own brief to create an Operating System (OS) that centres around a
                    Voice User Interface (VUI). I felt that the current OS’s for popular smart devices such as Android and iOS are too
                    distracting for the user, creating some bad habits for the user to get out of. I thought a new OS that has a
                    healthier relationship between the user and their device would increase productivity and create a better human
                    experience with their day to day lives.
                </p>

            <div class="item-b">
                <div class="img"></div>

            <article class="item-c">
                <p>Problem: We are living in a world where we can easily be distracted from the task at hand. Notifications and endless
                scrolling are two of the main features which helps businesses increase the amount of time a user spends on an app, but
                it can also create an overall negative experience for the user by sucking away at their time during important tasks
                of the day.
                </p>

                <p>Solution: Focus is a new OS that puts the users goals and needs first by recapturing the users attention to the task
                    at hand. I thought about creating a new User Experience where it is harder for the user to be distracted on the device.
                    The back bone to the OS is Maytee, a smart assistant that has access to all your information in every app.

                <div class="img"></div>
            </div>
            <article class="item-e" class="p-left">
                <p>There is no home page for your apps. Instead the user speaks into the device to call up the assistant or open an app. Tap
                and select different task options to configure the type of task you want to complete. Listen and the assistant will
                provide the user with feedback and reminders. The smart assistant can listen out for multiple tasks set by the user and
                will return a chain of tasks in multiple apps that the user can confirm on. Tasks that weren’t completed earlier can be
                re-organised for a better suited time. To help the assistant how you’re getting along, Maytee will message the user to
                see how they are getting along which will help encourage the user to work more.

            <article class="item-g">
                <p>Focus comes with all the core tools that your assistant will need to keep track of the users life. Certain tasks that
                the assistant can carry out are: scheduling appointments and meetings in the Calendar, messaging friends and
                colleagues in Contacts or setting Reminders and organising notes in Projects. When the assistant is called, the device
                screen is split into "multi-task" mode. This is where the user is currently in one app but the assistant is listening to
                the user and creating tasks to be used in other apps.

                <h4>This was my biggest project that I have done, designing over 50 unique mockups! The most challenging part of the brief 
                was the scale of the project and sticking to the design components that make up the OS. If you want to find
                out more, I would be more than happy to talk to you about the development and my design thinking behind the project at
                an interview. Here are some of the points that I will be glad to talk about: <br>
