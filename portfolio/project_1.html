                <h1>Focus OS – A less distracting device.</h1>
                <h4>Role: UX Researcher, UX/UI Designer, Visual Designer</br>
                    Conducted user profiles, sketched and created wireframes, created hi-fi mockups, prototyped with hi-fi comps
                </h4>
                <p>For my Final Major Project at University, I set my own brief to create an Operating System (OS) that centres around a
                    Voice User Interface (VUI). I felt that the current OS’s for popular smart devices such as Android and iOS are too
                    distracting for the user, creating bad habits that the user then finds difficult to break. I thought a new OS that has a
                    healthier relationship between the user and their device would increase productivity and create a better human
                    experience with their day to day lives.
                </p>

            <article class="item-c">
                <p>Problem: We are living in a world where we can easily be distracted from the task at hand. Notifications and endless
                scrolling are two of the main features which help businesses increase the amount of time a user spends on an app. However,
                it can also create an overall negative experience by reducing the time the user spends doing important tasks.
                </p>

                <p>Solution: Focus is a new OS that puts the user's goals and needs first by recapturing the users attention to the task
                    in hand, making it less distracting.
                    The back bone to the OS is Maytee, a Smart Assistant that has access to all the users information in every app.

            </div>
            <article class="item-e" class="p-left">
                <p>There is no home page for your apps. Instead the user speaks into the device to either call the assistant or open an app. Tap
                and select different task options to configure the type of task you want to complete. Listen and the assistant will
                provide the user with feedback and reminders. The Smart Assistant can listen out for multiple tasks set by the user and
                will return a chain of tasks in multiple apps that the user can confirm or otherwise. Tasks that weren’t completed earlier can also be
                re-organised for a better suited time. To help the Assistant know how you’re getting along, Maytee will message the user to
                find out their progress periodically.

                <p>Focus comes with all the core tools that your Assistant will need to keep track of the users life. Particular tasks that
                the Assistant can carry out are: Scheduling appointments and meetings in the Calendar; messaging friends and
                colleagues in Contacts, or setting Reminders as well as organising notes in Projects. When the Assistant is called, the device
                screen is split into "multi-task" mode. This is where the user is currently working in one app but the Assistant can listen to
                the user and create tasks in other apps.

                <h4>This was the biggest project that I have done, designing over 50 unique mockups. The most challenging part of the brief 
                was the scale of the project and sticking to the design components that make up the OS. If you want to find
                out more, I would be more than happy to talk to you about the development, and my design thinking behind the project, at
                an interview. Here are just some of the points that I would be more than happy to talk about: <br>
