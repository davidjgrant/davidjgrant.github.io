                    My favourite meal is a bowl, filled with couscous, chicken and salad. I love it so much, that I decided
                    to design a website that could deliver my favourite meal to my door every.single.day. I combined the vast selection that a takeaway chain like, for instance, Subway offers,
                    along with the ease of ordering food online and having it delivered directly to you just like Just Eat does.

                <p>Hot Pot is centered around the gloriness of couscous. Inspired by its North African originality, Hot Pot invites the customer
                    to try a wide variety of different flavoured couscous with added extras. Using the web app, the menu is divided into four sections: Couscous, Meat or Fish, Salad and
                    Extras. Making your way through each section, the customer can pick and then add whatever they want for a personalised great tasting meal.

                <p>The Hot Pot brand has a core mission to substitute the lowly sandwich on-a-plate to the delicious couscous-in-a-bowl. Starting with one takeaway shop,
                    the brand has an aspiring dream to become a large chain spreading all across the world. Considered a healthier alternative to some of the other fast food outlets, Hot Pot can serve all customers
                    with different dietry requirements. Inspired by the street food of North Africa, the branding is fun and welcoming and the food is served in highly decorative tagines.

                <h4>I thoroughly enjoyed designing this website as I genuinely feel this could be a successful business plan.
                    (If you're reading this and also think the same, i'm more than happy to talk you through my thoughts!)
                    The branding is highly visible throughout the website, inpsired by the decorative clay tagines. I would love the opportunity to explain the choices I made and the design process at interview.</h4>
