                    My favourite meal to eat is a bowl full of couscous, chicken and salad. I love it so much, that I decided
                    to design a website that could me my favourite meal to my door. I combined the vast selection that Subway offers,
                    with the comfortableness of ordering food online and having it delivered for you just like Just Eat.

                <p>Hot Pot is centered around the gloriness of couscous. Inspired by its North African originality, Hot Pot invites the customer
                    to try a wide variety of different flavoured couscous. Using the web app, the menu is divided into four sections: Couscous, Meat or Fish,
                    Extras and Drinks. Going through each section, the customer can pick and add whatever they want for a great tasty meal.

                <p>The Hot Pot brand has a core mission to substitute the sandwich on a plate to a bowl full of couscous. Starting off as one resteraunt,
                    it has an aspiring dream to become a large chain spreading over the world. Considered a healthier alternative, Hot Pot can serve all customers
                    with different dietry requirements. Inspired by the street food in North Africa, the branding is fun and welcoming and the  dishes the food is 
                    served in are based on actual decorative bowls.
